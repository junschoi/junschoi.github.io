Before I committed myself to learning Python and data science, I used to manage Amazon 3rd party seller&amp;rsquo;s warehouse and work as a freight forwarder, coordinating both import and export shipments.
My main programming language is Python. I decided to learn Python around late 2019 because I was looking for ways to automate my tasks and perform data analysis, and Python seemed to be the best option from my research.</description></item></channel></rss>
