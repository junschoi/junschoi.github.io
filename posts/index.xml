Because scanned documents were often in image format, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to just copy paste the contents for my tasks so my work involving scanned documents took way longer than documents that were in normal text format. If you are having a similar problem and don&amp;rsquo;t want to type out everything from the document, perhaps this post will help you.</description></item><item><title>Vimium for Google Chrome</title><link>https://junschoi.github.io/posts/vimium_chrome/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 17:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://junschoi.github.io/posts/vimium_chrome/</guid><description>For people who want to browse the web without using the mouse, I recommend getting Vimium extension for Google Chrome or Firefox. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Vimium extension since May 4th, 2020, and it drastically improved my web browsing experience. If you are also thinking about changing from full-sized or 80% (ten keyless) keyboard to 60% or 40% keyboard, I recommend getting Vimium or a similiar type of extention since you&amp;rsquo;ll be operating with less keys.</description></item><item><title>Fixing Mojibake using Python and ftfy</title><link>https://junschoi.github.io/posts/ftfy_guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 03:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://junschoi.github.io/posts/ftfy_guide/</guid><description>Have you ever had this problem where foreign languages appear in gibberish?
Mojibake (文字化け) occurs when someone has encoded Unicode with one standard and decoded it with a different one. The result is the garbled text that you see in the picture above. In Japanese, the word literally translates to “character changing”.
This was a problem back when Unicode wasn’t around and different countries were using their own encoding systems.</description></item><item><title>iTunes Library Data Analysis using Python</title><link>https://junschoi.github.io/posts/itunes_library_analysis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 02:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://junschoi.github.io/posts/itunes_library_analysis/</guid><description>If you use iTunes to listen to your music, you can export your iTunes library data as an XML file!
Open iTunes File &amp;gt; Export Library&amp;hellip; Save the file at your desired directory
There are many ways to parse an XML file, but in this demo, I will be using xml.etree.ElementTree module to parse it. You can read more about the module here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html
If you open the XML file with a text editor, you will see that the data inside the XML file is structured like the screenshot below.</description></item><item><title>Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets</title><link>https://junschoi.github.io/posts/partition_k_equal_subsets/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 02:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://junschoi.github.io/posts/partition_k_equal_subsets/</guid><description>This is problem 698 on leetcode. The solution function below is very similar to the one that is provided by leetcode but I made some changes to the solutions function so that it also returns the subsets when it&amp;rsquo;s possible to divide the array into k subsets.
Problem Statement
Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, find whether it&amp;rsquo;s possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.</description></item><item><title>Linear Programming Demo</title><link>https://junschoi.github.io/posts/linear_programming_demo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 13:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://junschoi.github.io/posts/linear_programming_demo/</guid><description>There are many python packages that we can use to solve linear programming problems. We will be using scipy&amp;rsquo;s linprog method.

Example 1 A farmer has 240 acres of land. An acre of corn will yield 40 USD in profit while an acre of oats will yield 30 USD in profit. He has 320 hours available to work on his farm. An acre of corn requires 2 hours of labor while an acre of oats requres only 1 hour of labor.</description></item></channel></rss>
